			<hr>
			<p>Bullshit Breaker is a game I made with my friends Forrest and Juliette at this years Hack the North hackathon at the University of Waterloo. We decided we wanted to learn Python in the 36 hour hackathon and use it to make an election related game. Bullshit breaker is a version of brick breaker in which the bricks are Donald Trump's bullshit tweets, and you literally get to break up the bullshit. We used the twitter API to fetch live tweets and sentiment analysis to determine their level of b.s. We ended up being Hack the North finalists which was an incredible experience.

See the code on github <a href="https://github.com/htnglowingpotato/project" class="underline">here</a>.</p>

			<p>Cube field runner is a videogame I made that placed 3rd at the 2016 Uncommon Hacks hackathon. It's loosely based on the game cube runner; imagine cube runner but in 3d space so you can move up and down as well as the original left and right. Use the arrow keys to play and make sure to check out Uncommon mode. Play <a href="https://tbpeters.github.io/index.html" class="underline">here</a> (Heads up it only works in chrome). Devpost link <a href="http://devpost.com/software/cube-field-runner" class="underline">here</a>. See the code on github <a href="https://github.com/tbpeters/tbpeters.github.io" class="underline">here</a>.</p>
